# Binary To Decimal Converter

C# implementation of a binary-to-decimal converter

### Overview

This solution provides a practical implementation of a binary-to-decimal converter in C#, designed to demonstrate
various conversion techniques and approaches in programming.

The solution comprises three main projects:

- **[Converter](BinaryToDecimalConverter.Converter)**: a collection of binary to decimal number converters using
  positional notation and doubling. Each converter is implemented both iteratively and functionally (using LINQ).
- **[Test](BinaryToDecimalConverter.Test)**: a set of unit tests implemented in NUnit for each of the converters to
  ensure their correctness and reliability.
- **[UI](BinaryToDecimalConverter.UI)**: a WPF-based user interface for user interaction with the converters, allowing
  easy input and display of results.

> **_NOTE:_** Due to its educational nature, this project is not intended to
> represent a production-ready solution. It is a demonstration of various design
> patterns, advanced features, and coding techniques. While the code may illustrate
> good programming practices, it may not adhere to all the best practices necessary
> for a real-world, production-grade application.
